This repo contains some code implemented using Ratpack's Promise implementation, there are some bugs for you to fix.

Tests will fail on first run and the code needs fixing to make them pass.

You will need Java 11 SDK installed and JAVA_HOME set on your PATH environment variable.

You should be able to run `./gradlew test` in order to run the tests in the repo. If you are running on a Windows machine you can run `./gradlew.bat test` instead.

This is the expected output for test failure:

```
$ ./gradlew test
